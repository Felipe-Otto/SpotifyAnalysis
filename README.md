 ### Project Description:
The Spotify Analysis Project embodies a fusion of technical skills and data exploration. Using **Python**, **ETL** processes, **Power BI**, and **Data Visualization**, this initiative is centered around the dynamic and vast ecosystem of Spotify's API.

Through the Spotify Developer Dashboard, an application was crafted, unlocking the gateway to invaluable credentials for delving into the wealth of data hidden within the world of curated playlists.

Harnessing the power of Python, an ETL process was meticulously designed. It delicately plucked select data from Spotify playlists, massaging and refining it into a structured and organized JSON format. This data was then ushered into the capable hands of Power BI, where it was transformed into visual stories, revealing patterns, insights, and trends that lay hidden within the musical universe.

This project epitomizes the synergy between programming prowess and the richness of Spotify's data, encapsulating the essence of data-driven exploration and the profound narratives that emerge from this melodic journey.


### Getting Started
#### Spotify API:

>  To begin, access the following link and log in with your Spotify account:
    <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard" target="_blank">Spotify Developer Dashboard</a>

>    Create an app, access it, and go to settings

>    Copy your credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) and keep them secure

#### Python Code:

> Clone this repository: https://github.com/Felipe-Otto/SpotifyAnalysis.git

> Insert your credentials into the spotify_credentials.txt file

> Run the Python script main.py

> Run the Python script main.py

> The extracted data will be in the 'extraction' folder
